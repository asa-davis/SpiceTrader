    - merge village factory class with ent factory. What do we do with village location inner class???
    - don't let pirates spawn next to beach tiles, they get stuck
    - replace all instances of MainGame constants being passed as parameters with direct references ie MainGame.CONST_VAR?
    - instead of getting entire path, pirates should only be requesting next tile from dijkstra map
    - generalize dijkstra map methods
    - fix bug where dead pirates board player in the time between when they take a hit and get deleted
