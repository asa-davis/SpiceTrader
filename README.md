TODO (1/1/21)
- Features to Add
    - trading 
        - expand on docked menu
        - add datastructures to Village to hold current trade, inventory, etc.
        - unique names for villages
        - clicking on a village you haven't visited yet reveals "unknown village", but if you have visited them, you get more info
    - pirate bases
        - spawn pirates
        - pirates wander nearby their base unless a player approaches. (use dijkstra map class?)
        - shoot at player
        - these increase in frequency the farther out from center of map you go
        - destroying a pirate base allows player to dock there and acquire gold/items
    - cooldown on cannons
    - dont let pirates get within a certain radius of friendly ports. display radius?
    - (IMPORTANT) different map hitboxes for different tile types
    - falling off world death/outer world textures
    - starting area/upgrade shop
    - sea monsters
    - quest/winning the game
    
- Features to Investigate
    - better approach to pirates - make them deal damage on contact and only board at low hull? Add mechanic to fight them off?
    - health bars above enemies
    - customize starting stats at beginning of game, fallout style
    - randomly generated equippable items, bordlerlands style
    - click approach to cannons: allow player to shoot with mouse as long as shot is within a small arc of cannon direction
    - have camera rotate when you turn - would need to change textures to top down only :(

- Fixes/Refactoring
    - merge village factory class with ent factory. What do we do with village location inner class???
    - don't let pirates spawn next to beach tiles, they get stuck
    - replace all instances of MainGame constants being passed as parameters with direct references ie MainGame.CONST_VAR?
    - instead of getting entire path, pirates should only be requesting next tile from dijkstra map
    - generalize dijkstra map methods
    - fix bug where dead pirates board player in the time between when they take a hit and get deleted
