TODO (11/29/20):
- implement pirate pathfinding (in progress)
    - build dijkstra map from player position - stored in map object?
    - on pirate tick, if in range, build path to current player position from dijkstra map
    - convert to list of point coords (centers of tiles)
    - (optional)simplify using Ramer–Douglas–Peucker algorithm
    - track next waypoint in pirate class and check if it gets close enough in pirate tick()
- change all uses of Vector2 class to int[] when used for tile coords - all these floats are slowing down the game!
- extend Menu/MenuManager to implement hud/inventory menus
- implement trading 
    - add datastructures to Village to hold current trade, inventory, etc.
    - implement execution of trades through DockedMenu
- improve map hitboxes 
    - use different rectangle/polygon based on neighbor bitmask instead of always 16x16 square
- add falling off world death
- work on starting area idea
- work on upgrade mechanic
- work on sea monster mechanic
