TODO (5/31/21)
- Features to Add
    - pirate wandering 
        - two modes: guard and chase
        - have each pirate village generate a dijkstra map once pointing back to spawn location.
        - would like to have pirates wander, but this requires too much dijkstra map generation.
        - Could potentially switch to A* to achieve this at a later date.
    - cooldown on cannons
    - trading 
        - expand on docked menu
        - add datastructures to Village to hold current trade, inventory, etc.
        - unique names for villages
        - clicking on a village you haven't visited yet reveals "unknown village", but if you have visited them, you get more info
    - dont let pirates get within a certain radius of friendly ports. display radius?
    - (IMPORTANT) different map hitboxes for different tile types
    - falling off world death/outer world textures
    - starting area/upgrade shop
    - sea monsters
    - quest/winning the game (sea monsters)
    - add better pirate death textures
    - whitewater trail behind ships
    - Startup screen
    
- Features to Investigate
    - health bars above enemies
    - customize starting stats at beginning of game, fallout style
    - randomly generated equippable items, bordlerlands style
    - click approach to cannons: allow player to shoot with mouse as long as shot is within a small arc of cannon direction
    - have camera rotate when you turn - would need to change textures to top down only :(
    - rewards for killing pirates
    - persistant upgrades/unlocks?
    - biomes

- Fixes/Refactoring
    - only players should have strike cooldown, not pirates
    - replace all instances of Vector2 being used for tile coords with int[]s. why use floats to store int values??
    - merge village factory class with ent factory. What do we do with village location inner class???
    - fix bug where you can sail underneath pirates
    - replace all instances of MainGame constants being passed as parameters with direct references ie MainGame.CONST_VAR?
    - fix bug where dead pirates board player in the time between when they take a hit and get deleted
    - fix rare damage flash bug
    - pirates shouldn't come after player when he gets within certain radius of village (then we can remove the code that pauses game when docked)
    - keep pirate villages from spawning near trading villages
